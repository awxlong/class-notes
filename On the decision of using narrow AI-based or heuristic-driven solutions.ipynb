    "# When to use Artificial Intelligence to solve a problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "__First note__: The following article is intended to audience who's trying to decide whether a problem should be solved using Artificial Intelligence methods or not. It can be for industrial purposes such as deciding where to allocate resources on (AI pipeline or not), or academic purposes, such as deciding whether a project's problem is suitable to be addressed using AI. If you enjoy exploring AI across various settings, and wants to experiment using AI or non-AI-based solutions to tackle different problems, then you can consider this article as simply sharing my experiences, which can hopefully help you in anyway possible in your journey learning AI. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Second note__: I use the term 'Artificial Intelligence' as an _euphemism_ to refer to kinds of solutions which I consider fundamentally different to heuristics-based or analytical solutions. Although the correct term should be narrow-AI based solution. Here is a table to illustrate the differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "| AI-based solution (also called narrow AI)  | Heuristics-based solution (also referred as analytical)|\n",
    "| ------------- |:-------------:| \n",
    "| Usually probabilistic in nature   | Usually deterministic in nature | \n",
    "| Usually poor explainability or interpretability      | Usually good explainability and interpretability      | \n",
    "| Examples involve deep neural networks, reinforcement learning | Examples include linear regression, tree-search algorithms      | \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, on the question of whether AI should be used to tackle certain problem. I come across this question quiet often with my colleagues, which is why I'll share in this following notebook my own thoughts and opinions on this matter, which is derived from my own adventure in studying AI algorithms and models✌️. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm already fully convinced that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be a core protagonist of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (see a brief discussion in [my website](https://notesre.wixsite.com/website)). This has attracted a lot of enthusiasts across the world (like me) to learn the algorithms and models proposed in the quest to achieve AI. However, not all the models or algorithms as of 2022[^1] are close in achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and they are mostly specialized into solving a task in a simplified setting tackling a problem reminiscence of a human faculty (although it's true that as the years go by, assumptions and restrictions are being lifted off, and the models, algorithms and data are being tweaked or enhanced so that they can work for more generalized tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, the point is that there is yet an algorithm or model that can work for every known problem in math, and I want to share with you some of the tips I've learned when deciding what kind of problem should be solved using AI and which should follow a non-AI paradigm, that is, be solved using an analytical solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An AI solution is preferred to problems which are hard to be distilled mathematically\n",
    "    - Although the pursuit of AI is to solve any problem (i.e. domain generalization), a simple heuristic can sometimes be more time and memory efficient than an AI solution.\n",
    "    - The more you understand the problem, the less likely it's to be solved using  an AI algorithm.\n",
    "    - Example: The Tower of Hanoi puzzle is a problem that can be solved using a reinforcement learning agent, but it's better solved through a recursive algorithm.\n",
    "- An AI solution is preferred when the variables involved in the problem (input features predicting an output) don't follow a monotonic relationship and/or can't be linearised\n",
    "    - An AI solution is preferred for a task when a model has to capture the non-linear, non-monotonic relationship between input features and output. \n",
    "    - Models where there exists a linear or monotonic relationship between input features and output usually focus on their parameters' interpretability and explainability, while those that don't have such linear relationships care more about the accuracy of the models' predictions and optimal performance in a task.  \n",
    "    - Input features that usually bear no relationship with the output usually correspond to unstructured data, while those which do display some sort of monotonic relationship are carefully-processed data, which may have research backing then up.\n",
    "    - Example: The task of cat image recognition based on input features consisting of pixels is better solved using an AI algorithm like deep learning. The task of coronary artery disease (CAD) detection based on known physiological features like age, gender or cholesterol levels are better solved using logistic regression.\n",
    "- __A symbiosis rather than zero-sum choice__\n",
    "    - A purely AI solution may optimally solve a task and can generalize to different environments, but it may be time-consuming. A pure non-AI, heuristic solution may require too much understanding of a problem beforehand and can't be generalized. A mix of both strategies, such as what AlphaGo does by mixing reinforcement learning paradigm of environment interaction based on a tree-search heuristic can be better at solving a task. Albeit the creativity that is required to extrapolate the advantages of both the AI and non-AI paradigm may also be challenging. \n",
    "- NP problems, Artificial General Intelligence and quantum computing\n",
    "    - It seems as though heuristics are preferred for polynomially-solvable problems since they aren't as cumbersome and time-consuming as AI-based solutions. What about NP problems? \n",
    "    - Will the above recommendations still be useful once we achieve Artificial General Intelligence?\n",
    "    - NP problems have the quality of being non-polynomial due to the fundamental, discrete, binary nature of computation. If quantum computing, which proposes that a state can be evaluated to different values at the same time, can simplify NP problems to P, then will all problems be solved through a simple, AI-General heuristic?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: I have to add \"2022\" because the pace in which AI algorithms and models are developing is exponentially fast (see *The Singularity is Near, by Ray Kurzweil*) to the point that by next year, or next 5 years, we just might witness an \"Universal Algorithm\" which allows a model to solve any kind of task and the whole argument of when to use AI to solve a problem is pointless."

    "## An AI solution is preferred to problems which are hard to be defined mathematically\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems that can't be thoroughbly described through math and theorems are better left for a ML algorithm to solve. Converselly, problems which have a thorough mathematic definition and are understandable through math are better solved analytically. Here, to be \"precisely mathematically defined\" is subject to discussion. It could be that the task has a clearly defined goal where there is known to be a correct result, or that there is a precise \"mathematical abstraction\" of it. Let me illustrate it with an example of solving the task consisting of the puzzle of Tower of Hanoi (ToH):\n",

    "![tower](tower_of_hanoi.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure: The game starts with the state at top left corner, at an initial state where *n* disks are placed in the leftmost rod, and goal is to place all disks to the rightmost rod. It's illegal to put a larger disk on top of a smaller one. Only one disk can be moved per more. Here *n = 3*, and it takes $2^n - 1 = 7$ moves to move all disks as required. Figure extracted from https://clipground.com/tower-of-types-of-clipart.html. For the actual game please visit: https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Well... what do you think? \"**Should**\" this problem be solved using ML or analytically? \n",
    "\n",
    "My answer would be that this problem **can** be solved using ML, however, it's more time and memory-efficient to simply use an analytical solution given that ToH is a **mathematically, well-defined problem**:\n",
    "- The end state is explicit: all n disks have to be at the rightmost rod\n",
    "- The rules of the game leave no ambiguity and they're easily understandable: there are only 3 rods, one can't move more than 1 disk per turn. \n",
    "- There is well-defined strategy to play the game. This bullet point is important, given that ToH allows for some interesting backward, inductive reasoning. To actually achieve the end state, we should be aware that the nth disk (the largest one) should move only *once* to the third rod, which implies the second rod has all n - 1 disks. And they got there because each one of the top level disks has been moved to the surrounding 2 rods to make space for lower-level disks, and each one of them had to make two-step moves exponentially in order to do so (this is better observed using fewer disks). Through this reasoning, ToH can be solved with a minimum, therefore optimally, $2 ^ n -1$ moves, which means that its computation should be $O(2^n)$ for both running time and memory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**In general, the more we understand a problem and can mathematically-distill it, the less likely it's to be solved using  an AI algorithm.** This is nonetheless different than saying we can't solve it using AI, it's just that it'll be time-cumbersome due to training, or memory inefficient due to the storage of state-value or weight matrices depending on which paradigm you're using. Moreover, assuming we're employing techniques from the connectionist school such as deep learning (DL) or reinforcement learning (RL), then because of the probabilistic/statistical nature of those approaches, we might get different results that are not the optimal, which we could have gotten through an analytical approach which gives a sole answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyhow, at the beginning, I did try to solve ToH using AI 😂. Namely, given that ToH is not about predicting something from features, I chose RL which I learnt from a [Coursera course on RL offered by the University of Alberta](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-reinforcement-learning), which is an AI paradigm which focuses on exploration and interaction with a digital environment (the rods in this case) to maximize a reward (to reach the end state in this case).  This required me to implement an environment, and solve it using a  SARSA Agent following this [template](https://github.com/clarisli/RL-Easy21). The code is in my [GitHub](https://github.com/awxlong/tower-of-hanoi-RL), albeit I also copied down in the __Appendix Section__. The general idea of RL is very interesting. In this case of ToH, the agent had to move disks randomly at the beginning, and reach the final state. Because there is a state-value matrix which stores information about visiting states that yields the highest value, it can subsequently greedily choose, iterate and modify the values of this matrix so that it can choose the sequence of states which maximizes the reward (helps it reach the end state while not making illegal moves). While I enjoyed a lot being able to apply what I've learned from Coursera on a math puzzle I liked, I do admit that I don't want to try solving ToH using RL 😂. To be even more honest, I'm not even sure the RL code can actually complete the game in the optimal $2^n - 1$ moves, and things would get extremely ugly as the number of disks increases, which means an exponential increase in computation time. The state-value matrix I designed occupies a memory which is $O(6n^3)$, albeit it can be reduced by choosing a better way to represent the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It isn't really recommended to use AI on ToH given how much of ToH can be mathematically distilled, and therefore tackled using an analytical solution. Actually, a recursive solution uploaded by Harshit Agrawal in [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-for-tower-of-hanoi/?msclkid=738a989dad1811eca9e01c56a99e8193) can solve the ToH in about 6 lines of code, it finds the optimal solution whilst avoiding the training of an agent and estimation of a value matrix:"

    "## An AI solution is preferred when the variables involved in the problem (input features predict an output) don't follow a monotonic relationship and/or can't be linearised\n",
    "This next reason can technically be deduced from the above tip, that is, use an AI solution if a problem can't be thoroughly mathematically abstracted (although this wouldn't be a list with only one item 😂). Again, let's use an example in a healthcare setting, where I want to predict whether a person has a heart disease from the following set of features: gender, age, cholesterol level and heart rate. It's well backed-up by extensive research that, on average, fluctuations in these features can have a significant impact on whether a person is predicted to having heart disease or not. What's important is that there exists a linear relationship between heart disease (output) and the input features, and therefore this prediction task is better left for logistic regression or classification tree, rather than deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "![non-lin-lin](non-linearity-vs-linearity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure: Some problems where input features don't share a linear relationship with the output may require adding non-linearities in between so that they can be mapped consistently. The non-linearities of the deep neural network correspond to ReLu activations. The notation is as follows: x_i are the input features, while k_j would be the class. On the right I tried to illustrate a logistic regression models where inputs are mapped directly using a sigmoid function to the output, where the output is very likely the log odds of the outocme. Illustration edited from: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/An-illustration-of-a-deep-neural-network_fig4_333049256![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "Even if variables share non-linear relationship, we should still first look at the available literature about whether there exists ways to linearise them, id est, exponential or potential relationships can be linearised using logarithms, we could also take the logarithm of the odds or go for standardization of input features. This reinforces a previous idea that the more we understand and mathematically distill a problem, it's better to use an analytical approach to model and solve it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, what if the variables concerned share non-linear, non-monotonic and they can't be linearised? Then it's plausible to say that approaches like deep learning could be useful in solving this problem. Clear examples include today's famous problems of image recognition and machine translation. While both of them is about predicting some output (class label in the former, words in a desired language in the latter) given input features (pixels in the former, words in a language in the latter), there is just no research finding that suggest, for instance, that pixels follow a linear relationship with its associated class label (because otherwise a LinReg model could actually predict whether an image shows a cat or not). Another example would be if all words across all languages had an unique one-to-one mapping irrespective of context, and all shared the same grammar rules, then it's plausible to think that an analytical solution to machine translation would be a model consisting of a dictionary in charge of the one-to-one mapping and grammar rules of the desired language to produce a feasible translation. However, there are just an infinite amount of inconsistencies, irregularities, \"exceptions\" (and whatever other synonyms), that characterise human laguage, making it suitable to be tackled through AI algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate the point made above with two problems: cat image recognition from pixel inputs and coronary artery disease (CAD) detection from physiological features. Here, we'll propose that cat image recognition is a problem suitable to be tackled through deep learning because there exists a non-linear relationship between pixels and 'cat' class label, while CAD detection based on physiological features (e.g. age, sex, cholesterol levels, et al.) is more suitable for binary logistic regression because there is a linear relationship that can be taken advantage of. We can explore this assertion by running both deep learning and logistic regression on both problems (4 models in total) and analyse the results we get. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset I of cat images: convolutional deep learning vs. logistic regression\n",
    "The dataset 'train_catvnoncat.h5' and 'test_catvnoncat.h5' contain hundreds of 64 px * 64 px RGB pictures of cats and other non-cat things (e.g. landscapes, insects) that are offered in the Deep Learning Specialization in Coursera. The code below first loads and does some exploration of the dataset, and we'll subsequently run both a deep learning and logistic regression model and analyse the results we get. Here, we have to distinguish fundamental differences between the two tasks above. While image recognition is concerned with increasing the classification accuracy of a cat image, which implies that the model should, hopefully, be shape-, scale-, rotation-, brightness- invariant, the task of disease detection is more concerned on which features can significantly predict and by what extent the absence or presence of a disease. From these different purposes we can also identify when an AI solution is more suitable for each task. **When a task is more concerned in improving accuracy more than interpretability of its parameters, then it's likely to be addressed using an AI solution***. It's partly due to this reason that there is a *rise in the demand of explainable AI* given that AI models in the past and present are mostly concerned in solving a task rather than explaining how do they arrive at their solutions. I won't delve into details problems such as black box algorithms or dataset biases given that they're not the focus of today's notebook, but I do reinstate that they're present concerns in the AI community. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyhow, the assertion above can also be written as follows: ***Conversely, if a task is more concerned in interpretability of its parameters, then usually this entails a lower number of parameters, and which share a linear relationship with the output***.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To show the above idea, we can first start running a convolutional neural network (CNN) as well as a logistic regression model to solve the task of cat image recognition and compare interpretability and accuracy results. "

    "When running the model and obtaining the results, I was quiet shocked to see such a high testing accuracy😂! I guess it has to do with such a small dataset used for binary classification, i.e, the advantages of using an AI approach based on a CNN would be more noticeable if we were to deal with multi-class classification, along with a larger dataset. Regardless of such, some key points don't change:\n",
    "- Logistic regression is not suitable for image recognition. The testing accuracy for LogReg may increase by changing some hyperparameters like the solver utilized, but the fundamental idea behind Log.Reg, which is that a linear relationship can be captured between input features and output (the log odds of output to be precise, which still falls under the notion of \"relationships that can be linearised\") doesn't hold for image recognition.\n",
    "- There is however, an advantage of interpretability, where in this case we can make a (rather weird) statement that from the increase of any random pixel's value we can expect an unit change in the log odds of the outcome. This is some form of explainable AI, because we can't make a similar statement for the CNN above. This is because, without being too technical, while in LogReg we have 12288 features corresponding to the pixels of the image, there are > 20000 weights in the CNN corresponding to the kernel filters and fully connected layer's perceptrons (which can even increase furthermore). There is no linear relationship because a key idea behind CNNs is to add non-linearities using activation functions like Tanh or ReLu. \n",
    "- We can wonder then under what scenario would image recognition be suitable for LogReg. I'd say that if instead of using **unstructured** input data like matrix of pixels, we used small feature vectors like ['is_mammal', 'has_fur', weight, number_of_feet, 'can_fly'...], then because of the specificity of the features, as well as there is a plethora of zoological or biological research backing some of the features (such as all cats are mammals), then I'd argue that in this case LogReg would be better than CNN.

    "Based on these features, there are 5 classes of participants, where I think 0 denotes control. The rest, 1, 2, 3 and 4 may denote different degrees of severity of CAD, although I'm not sure given that the dataset owner didn't really explain what different classes entailed. Anyhow, we want to show that multinomial logistic regression, a non-AI approach, is more suitable in this case, so we'll begin with some data exploration, and first fit a DNN, then a Multinomial LogReg model and explain why in this case of CAD detection, LogReg is more suitable.

    "Alas! The deep neural network can definately achieve a higher accuracy than the log reg model. It can go even higher if we change some hyperparameters like number of perceptrons per each layers, change optimizer, increase iterations (try it yourself!👌). Of course, it also overfitted the training data due to the complexities of the neural network fit on such a small dataset where there was technically no need to add non-linearities, as we can extrapolate from the heatmat above. There are workarounds to this common issue, such as regularization, maybe having a larger dataset synthethized using maximum likelihood estimate, but I won't do it since that's also out of the focus of the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, back to the main topic, the idea is that logistic regression is better suited for addressing the task of CAD detection. Although it generalizes better than the DNN by having a larger test set accuracy, another important thing to consider is its interpretability. Here, the **explainability** of the model's parameters can be thought of as crucial, as implications of identifying and quantifying the relevant features that are associated with CAD can have public health policy implications. Moreover, once again we can also see that an interesting characteristic of LogReg is its deterministic feature. Although results can change depending on the solver or a few hyperparameters like regularization or number of iterations, it's not as probabilistic as its DNN counterpart. At the time of writing this, this has slowly morphed into a statistical problem, which further reinforces the notion of explainability of the LogReg model's parameters. We can also plausibly discuss the _significance_ of the parameters, as well as make causal inferences from it. Below is a summary of statistics of the estimated coefficients, albeit distilling also isn't the notebook's intention (nor something within my expertise😂). "

    "## A symbiosis rather than zero-sum choice\n",
    "The above tips sound as if one solution paradigm is distinctive to the other paradigm to the point that depending on the qualities of the problem, we should go one way or the other. I guess this is a plausible point, however, I think the tips above only work for problems on very practical settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we were doing a school project where we're given the freedom to decide how to solve a problem, but we're not specified what strategy to follow as long as we can achieve certain performance bottleneck, then some ideas shared above would hopefully help you on your decision. Another practical setting would be in the industrial environment. Assuming we're given a limited amount of resources to tackle certain problem, where meeting deadlines and achieving a performance benchmark are very important, then I guess we should first ask ourselves whether a simple heuristic could solve the task instead of experimenting with AI given their exhaustive demand in time for training and computational resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, for a non-practical setting, say for research purposes or simply for the joy of getting to know first-hand what are the advantages and limits of both AI and non-AI solution paradigms, then there are no brakes for trying out both, or mixing them up👌. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when reflecting on this issue I do find that a more \"powerful\" (if I may use that word) solution could result from a mix of both paradigms. A purely AI solution may optimally solve a task and can generalize to different environments, but it may be time-consuming or resource-demanding in terms of dataset or computational hardware. A pure non-AI, heuristic solution may require too much understanding of a problem beforehand and can't be generalized. A mix of both strategies, such as what AlphaGo does by mixing reinforcement learning paradigm of environment interaction, along with a tree-search heuristic can be better at solving a task. Albeit the creativity that is required to extrapolate the advantages of both the AI and non-AI paradigm may also be challenging. I think this kind of mixing is more noticeable for problems of rising complexity, especially in understanding human nature or human intelligence... Food for thought ✌️... \n",

    "- Will the above recommendations still be useful once we achieve Artificial General Intelligence?\n",
    "- NP problems have the quality of being non-polynomial due to the fundamental, discrete, binary nature of computation. If quantum computing, which proposes that a state can be evaluated to different values at the same time, can simplify NP problems to P, then will all problems be solved through a simple, AI-General heuristic?\n"
